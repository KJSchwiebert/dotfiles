# README

This Kyle Schwiebert's dotfiles github. For now it is just used to storing a configuration of vim.

In order to install it you will need to clone this repo (probably into ~/dotfiles) and then run

ln ~/dotfiles/.vim/vimrc .vimrc

OR

ln ~/dotfiles/.vim/vimrc .vim/vimrc

You may also need to install packages and/or the package manager (I have not yet tried this on another computer) vim-plug. The vim-plug file is available for symlinking in the above manner at dotfiles/.vim/plug.vim.

The command for installing pluggins is :PlugInstall. This will ony work once the vim-plug package manager is "working". :) Good Luck!
